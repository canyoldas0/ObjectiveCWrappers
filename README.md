<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The app encrypts or decrypts user's text input with basic encryption and decryption algorithms.

## Purpose of the Project

This project aims to understand how Objective-C/C++ wrappers work.

Objective-C wrappers helps us to reach C++ code inside of Swift language.

To do that, We wrap the C++ code with Objective-C, meaning that we create an environment that C++ can work, since Swift and Objective-C can communicate with each other without any additional methods.
